## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. 
If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 
I have made a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). 
It is a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
